/**
 * @brief Compares two integers without using conditional statements or direct comparison operators.
 * 
 * DO NOT use: `if`, `?:`, `switch`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `-`, `+`
 * You MAY use: `~`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `>>`, `<<`, `sizeof`
 * 
 * HINT:
 * - Consider the most significant differing bit.
 * - Think about how subtraction works in twoâ€™s complement.
 * - Use bitwise operations to extract and interpret the sign of the difference.
 * 
 * @tparam T Must be an integral type.
 * @param a First integer.
 * @param b Second integer.
 * @return -1 if a < b, 0 if a == b, 1 if a > b.
