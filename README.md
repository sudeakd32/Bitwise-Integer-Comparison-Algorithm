# Bitwise-Integer-Comparison-Algorithm

A high-performance C++ template implementation for comparing integers without using conditional statements or traditional comparison operators.
ðŸš€ Overview
This project implements a sophisticated integer comparison algorithm that operates purely through bitwise operations. The solution handles both signed and unsigned integers while maintaining optimal performance and memory efficiency.
âœ¨ Key Features

Zero Conditional Statements: No if, ?:, switch, <, >, <=, >= operators used
Pure Bitwise Operations: Leverages ~, &, |, ^, >>, << for all logic
Template-Based: Generic implementation supporting all integral types
Two's Complement Arithmetic: Advanced handling of signed integer edge cases
Overflow-Safe: Robust handling of integer limits and boundary conditions

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Compare two integers and return:

-1 if a < b
0 if a == b
1 if a > b

Without using any conditional statements or direct comparison operators.
